# html
HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design documents on the World Wide Web.
It provides a structured way to organize content by using a system of elements or tags that define the structure and presentation of a web page. HTML documents consist of a series of nested elements, each represented by tags enclosed in angle brackets (< >).

HTML tags describe different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more. The combination of HTML tags and the content they enclose forms the building blocks of a web page. Additionally, HTML allows the inclusion of attributes within tags to provide additional information or modify the behavior of elements.

Web browsers interpret HTML documents and render them as visually appealing and interactive web pages. HTML works in conjunction with other web technologies like Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript to enhance the presentation and functionality of websites. Overall, HTML serves as the foundation for creating the structure and content of web pages, facilitating the seamless integration of multimedia, hyperlinks, and interactive elements.
